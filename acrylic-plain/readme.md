# cool536-plate_acrylic-plain

## Notes
* Middle plate thickness: 3mm
* Middle plate 1 is used between the top plate and PCB, and middle plate 2 is used between PCB and bottom plate.
* When using FR4 top plate, it is recommended to insert a 0.5 mm silicone sheet between the top plate and the middle plate 1, since there will be a gap between the top plate and the middle plate.
